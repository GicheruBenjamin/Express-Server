Express is said to be unopinionated framework and no arguing about that. I have used it here to create a server.

## index.js
1. Express server is created.
2. A root route is created.
3. A POST route for handlimg data from index.html is created.
4. Listening to port 8000.

## index.html
A form for name and gmail (submit btn allows submission.) are there.
